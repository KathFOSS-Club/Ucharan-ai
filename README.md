# Ucharan-ai

Ucharan-ai is an open-source project focused on building a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Nepali language**. By converting written Nepali text into natural and intelligible speech, Ucharan-ai aims to make the Nepali language more accessible and interactive in the digital world.

## **Features**

- **Natural-Sounding Nepali Speech**: Generates high-quality speech output for Nepali text.
- **Customizable Voices**: Multiple voice tones and styles for different use cases.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles Nepali-specific text rules like Sandhi and Samasa.
- **User-Friendly API**: Easy integration into applications, websites, and devices.
- **Open-Source**: Built for the community to innovate and contribute.

## **Why Ucharan-ai?**

Languages like Nepali are often underrepresented in modern AI systems. Ucharan-ai seeks to bridge this gap by providing:

- **Accessibility**: Empowering visually impaired users with Nepali audio content.
- **Educational Tools**: Enhancing e-learning platforms with text-to-speech capabilities.
- **Language Preservation**: Promoting the use of Nepali in the digital era.
- **Localized Solutions**: Enabling Nepali-specific voice assistants and applications.
